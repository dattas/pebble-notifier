/**
 * <h1>Sensor API is a part of the Smart Extension APIs</h1>
 * <h3>Overview</h3>
 * <p>
 * The Sensor API is used to send accessory sensor data from a host application to
 * an accessory extension.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When a host application registers its capabilities, it will declare if it supports
 * the Sensor API and what sensors it exposes.
 * Extensions can use the Registration and Capability API to query host
 * applications for supported sensors.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In order to use this API, an application must have registered itself properly in
 * the registration content provider, see the Registration and Capabilities API.
 * </p>
 * <h3>How to register a listener</h3>
 * <p>
 * Sensor data is sent over a LocalSocket. In order to start communication the extension
 * should setup a LocalServerSocket {@link android.net.LocalServerSocket}
 * in listening mode and send the {@link Intents#SENSOR_REGISTER_LISTENER_INTENT} intent.
 * The capability API can be used to query the host application for supported sensors.
 * If multiple sensors are used, multiple LocalServerSocket objects must also be used since
 * one sensor is bound to exactly one LocalServerSocket.
 * When a extension registers a listener it also specifies what sample rate it wants to have.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Some sensors support interrupt mode.
 * They can be configured to only send sensor data when new values are available.
 * The interrupt flag is part of the sensor data registration Intent.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To unregister a listener the extension must send the {@link Intents#SENSOR_UNREGISTER_LISTENER_INTENT}.
 * </p>
 * <h3>Sensor data format</h3>
 * <p>
 * The sensor data is sent from the host application over a LocalSocket and can be accessed
 * through an InputStream.
 * The data has the following format:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Byte  0 -  3   Total length of the data package</li>
 * <li>Byte  4 -  7   Accuracy. For more information see {@link SensorAccuracy}</li>
 * <li>Byte  8 - 15   Timestamp. The time in nanosecond at which the event happened</li>
 * <li>Byte 16 - 19   Length of sensor values in bytes</li>
 * <li>Byte 20 - nn   Sensor values. This should be interpreted as an array of float values, each float value is 4 bytes</li>
 * </ul>
 * The length and contents of the values array depends on which sensor type is being monitored.
 * The data format is identical to a standard Android <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/SensorEvent.html#values">SensorEvent</a>.
 * </p>
