/**
 * <h1>Overview</h1>
 * <p>Notification is a part of the Smart Extension APIs.
 * The Notification engine enables the gathering of event-type data from different
 * sources to one place so that accessory host applications will be able to
 * access this data, instead of getting the data from each individual source.
 * Examples of event-data are activity streams on a social network, new incoming
 * SMS and MMS message notifications, a missed call notification, etc.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Application developers who wish to have their event-data presented by
 * accessories (granted with the permission to access the Notification
 * engine's data) should input their application's data according to the
 * schema defined by the Notification API.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The following diagram shows the position of the Notification API in its
 * operating context.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <img src="../../../../../../../images/notification_operating_environment.png"
 * alt="Operating context" border="1" />
 * </p>
 * The Notification API defines and implements an Android ContentProvider that
 * extensions access via the Android ContentResolver API. The ContentProvider
 * implementation is backed by a database implementation. In order for an extension
 * to interact with Notification API, the extension must have used the Registration API
 * and inserted information in the extension table. See Registration &amp; Capabilities API
 * for more information on how to insert a record in the extension table.
 * When needed, Android Intents are sent to the extensions to perform a task.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Extensions contribute their data using the set format dictated by the Notification API.
 * As they are standalone Android applications in their own right,
 * extensions may be uninstalled any time, unless they are part of the system
 * image, and may be installed any time during the operation of the device. They
 * may be &#39disabled&#39 as well by the end user via the user interface or by the
 * extension developer; when &#39disabled&#39, data from that extension may not be
 * displayed by the accessory host applications.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The accessory host applications provide the functionality to control and
 * present the data that is collected by the notification engine. Depending on the
 * purpose of the application, the notification engine may not be the only data
 * source the application interacts with. Accessory host applications have
 * read-access to the data provided by all the extensions, including the right to
 * update some of the data fields. Due to this reason, access needs to be controlled
 * and restricted so that unwanted information leaks are prevented;
 * this is done through the use of a permission.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The purpose of the engine is to provide a central store for event-data from
 * different sources that is of interest to present to the end user. The reasons
 * for choosing such a design are accessory host application performance and data
 * security. Cross-database queries are slow and even slower when there are
 * potentially many databases involved and this will severely impact the
 * performance of accessories and their perceived user experience.
 * It is difficult and practically impossible to allow the &#39correct&#39
 * applications to access the extension-data when there are many databases to
 * interact with. However tempting it may be, the purpose of the engine is NOT to
 * be a central store for all kinds of data, e.g. files, media etc., such that it
 * will be a &#34store room&#34 for all kinds of extension-data.

 * <h3>Concept Explanations</h3>
 * <p>
 * There are three fundamental concepts in the Notification engine's database
 * extension developers are required to understand.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The concept of <i>Extension</i> is on Android APK level. The extension table
 * of the registration database contains meta-information about each extension.
 * The purpose of the extension is to provide the necessary data to the notification
 * engine set by the database schema. The source of the extension's event-data may
 * be self-generated, other Android ContentProvider, a Web server or a combination of
 * these. The extension is a standalone application which may have its own GUI that
 * also has the capability to provide data to be shown by a host application
 * using the Notification engine, or it may not have its own GUI and it is
 * completely dependent on the host applications that use the Notification engine to
 * present its data.
 * </p>
 * <p><a name="SourceConcept"></a>
 * <i>Source</i> is a logical abstraction introduced to enable extension developers
 * who want to distinguish the presentation of data connected to different
 * backends but retain the ability to package these in a standalone APK. A use
 * case example is an email aggregator extension that allows the user to connect to
 * different email accounts through the installation of only one Android package
 * file; each email account can be set as a Source or the extension defines only
 * one Source. In the latter scenario, emails from all accounts may be shown
 * in one view instead of separate views. {@link Source} stores attribute
 * information about a Source. The accessory host application may use this
 * information to filter event-data by <i>Source</i> or provide
 * configuration options on the user interface to filter event-data by
 * <i>Source</i>.Extension developers who wish to have the accessory host
 * application display events from different <i>Sources</i>
 * clearly should add {@link Source} information.
 * Up to 8 sources can be linked to a <i>Extension</i>.
 * If the limit
 * is reached, an exception will be thrown. A <i>Source</i> always has to be
 * linked to an <i>Extension</i> .
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An <i>Event</i> is a representation of a notification that may be noteworthy
 * to present to the end user. Examples of events are incoming SMS
 * message notifications, a missed call notification, updates from friends on a
 * social network etc. {@link Event} is used to store events provided
 * by the extensions. The accessory host application typically uses the information
 * in this table to present the data. An <i>Event</i> is always connected
 * to a <i>Source</i> but a </i>Source</i> may not always have to have an
 * <i>Event</i>.
 * Maximum 100 events from a <i>Source</i>
 * stored in {@link Event}; when the limit is reached, events will be automatically
 * removed.
 * </p>

 * alt="Notification database" border="1" />
 * <a name="InterAppCommunication"></a>
 * <h3>Inter-application communication</h3>
 * <p>
 * Extensions only use the Android ContentResolver API to communicate with the
 * Notification engine's ContentProvider. For the possibility to react to user
 * input, extensions should implement at least an Android BroadcastReceiver to
 * catch Intents sent from the accessory host
 * applications. Also see the Control API, Widget API and Sensor API documentation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The list and descriptions of each BroadcastIntent extensions could listen to
 * are found in {@link Intents} together with the Intent-extra data
 * that are sent in each Intent.
 * </p>
 * <a name="Security"></a>
 * <h3>Security</h3>
 * <p>
 * In order to use the Notification API, an extension must first add information
 * in the extension table. This require a specific permission. See the documentation
 * of the Registration API for more information
 *</p>
 *<p>
 * A extension only has access to its own data: it is able to insert, query, update
 * and remove its data that is stored on the Notification engine. When an
 * application registered as a extension is uninstalled from the Android system,
 * the associated data that is stored in the engine is automatically removed
 * by the Notification engine's implementation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If a extension developer wishes to allow another application to access its data
 * on the engine through the use of <i>sharedUserId</i>, it is possible to do so
 * though not recommended. When these two or more applications are registered as
 * extensions, the Notification engine's security mechanism will only treat these
 * extensions as one extension and the extension developer is responsible for any leakage
 * or misuse of its information stored in the Notification engine's content
 * provider.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Extension developers are free to sign their applications with their own
 * certificate.
 * </p>
 *  <a name="ExtensionLifecycle"></a>
 * <h3>Extension Lifecycle</h3>
 * <p>
 * Before an application can take full advantage of the Notification engine,
 * it must tell the engine that it exists and for the engine to have a record
 * of this application's attributes. This process is known as registration and
 * after a successful registration, the application is referred as an extension in
 * the Notification engine's context. In practice, the process of registering
 * a extension involves the application inserting some data about itself using the
 * Registration API.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * From the Notification engine's perspective, the life cycle of a extension starts
 * from the time a successful registration takes place to the time the Android
 * system uninstalls the application or the extension deregisters itself from the
 * Notification engine. During this time, the extension is free to access the Event
 * Stream engine and receive Intents from it.
 * </p>
 *<a name="addSource"></a>
 * <h3>Adding a Source</h3>
 * <p>
 * As explained in an earlier section, <i>Source</i> is a logical abstraction
 * introduced to easily enable the presentation of event-data originating from
 * different backend. It is up to the extension developer to decide how to segment
 * the event-data contributed by that extension, but all event-data must be connected
 * to a Source, or else the insert operation for event-data will fail.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Setting the Source information in the ContentProvider should take place after
 * the extension is successfully registered and before inserting event-data.
 * <pre class="prettyprint">
 *        ContentValues values = new ContentValues();
 *        Builder iconUriBuilder = new Uri.Builder().scheme(ContentResolver.SCHEME_ANDROID_RESOURCE)
 *                                        .authority(getPackageName())
 *                                        .appendPath(Integer.toString(R.drawable.icon));
 *
 *        values.put(SourceColumns.NAME, "RSS news feed");
 *        values.put(SourceColumns.ENABLED, "1");
 *        values.put(SourceColumns.ICON_URI_1, iconUriBuilder.toString());
 *
 *        ...
 *
 *        uri = cr.insert(Source.URI, values);
 * </pre>
 * </p>
 * <a name="getevents"></a>
 * <h3>Getting event-data</h3>
 * Your extension may automatically retrieve event-data periodically from the source where the
 * event-data is generated or rely on an Intent sent by the host application to trigger
 * the retrieval.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The name of the Intent is {@link Intents#REFRESH_REQUEST_INTENT}.
 * Define your BroadcastReceiver to receive this Intent if you wish to rely on this to
 * trigger the event-data retrieval. Do not rely on the interval when this Intent is sent
 * as it may be arbitrary and completely dependent on the implementation of the Intent sender.
 * However it is always sent when a host application is started and an extension can use this to start
 * collecting data and continue to be be active.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When your extension has event-data to insert to the Notification engine's
 * ContentProvider, it may use
 * {@link android.content.ContentResolver#insert(Uri, android.content.ContentValues)}
 * or {@link android.content.ContentResolver#bulkInsert(Uri, android.content.ContentValues[])}.
 * The latter method is recommended for performance reasons to use when there are many
 * rows of event-data to insert.
 * <pre class="prettyprint">
 *        ContentResolver cr = getContentResolver();
 *        ContentValues[] valueArray = new ContentValues[count];
 *        &lt fill valueArray with data &gt
 *        cr.bulkInsert(Event.URI, valueArray);
 * </pre>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When retrieving event-data from the data source, it is highly recommended your
 * extension updates and retrieves other relevant data from the same data source,
 * e.g. the user's latest status update, at around the same time. This is to
 * minimize network signaling traffic and latency. It is also costly for battery
 * consumption if there is too frequent network signaling activity.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If you need to synchronize periodically with a server in a network, consider
 * using the {@link android.app.AlarmManager} to achieve optimal power consumption.
 * A tutorial explaining how you can implement this is posted at the
 * <a href="http://blogs.sonyericsson.com/developerworld/2010/08/23/android-tutorial-reducing-power-consumption-of-connected-apps/">
 * Sony Ericsson Developer blog</a>.
 * </p>
 * <a name="viewEvent"></a>
 * <h3>Showing the Detail View of an Event</h3>
 * <p>
 * The event-data supplied by your plug-in in {@link Event} may be a snapshot of
 * the information and the user has limited possibilities to interact with the
 * information presented by the accessory host application. The user may wish to
 * see all details related to that event and react to it, e.g. mark it as a
 * favorite, reply, watch the video etc. If your extension offers the user the
 * opportunity to interact with the event in your application or on a website,
 * listen for the {@link Intents#VIEW_EVENT_INTENT} Intent. This Intent
 * is sent by the accessory host application when the user performs an action
 * signaling the intention to view the event details. The Intent contains Intent-
 * data about the specific event-data that will enable your extension to launch the
 * detail view of that event.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <a name="Images"></a>
 * <h3>Handling Images</h3>
 * <p>
 * The location of images is represented as a string. Images may be stored
 * locally on the device or on the SD card.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The following URI schemes are supported:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>android.resource://
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * content://
 * </li>
  * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <a name="DataIntegrity"></a>
 * <h3>Data Integrity</h3>
 * <p>
 * In order to have a consistent database, the Notification Engine will enforce
 * database data integrity upon any data inserted or updated by extensions. This is
 * especially true for foreign keys. As an example, <i>sourceId</i> for an
 * <i>Event</i> is a foreign key to the column <i>_id</i> in the <i>Source</i>
 * table, thus the <i>source_id</i> must have a valid reference to a row in the
 * <i>Source</i> table which in turn is associated with a plug-in. If values for
 * the stated mandatory columns are not provided, SQLExceptions with constraint
 * failures will be thrown.
 * </p>
 * <a name="Performance"></a>
 * <h3>Performance</h3>
 * <p>
 * For best performance, it is recommended the extension developer use
 * {@link android.content.ContentResolver#bulkInsert(Uri, android.content.ContentValues[])}
 * or {@link android.content.ContentResolver#applyBatch(String, java.util.ArrayList)}
 * when doing inserts or updates to the Event Stream&#39s ContentProvider.
 * </p>
